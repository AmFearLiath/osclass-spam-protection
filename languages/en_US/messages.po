"            <br /><br />\n"
"            An automated system would always involve the risk that even "
"realistic ads will be marked as spam and not published.\n"

"            If you find any errors, please report it in the forum and tell "
"it to me. \n"
"            I will try to fix this immediately, so that everyone can use "
"this plugin properly.<br /><br />\n"
"            Also i would be glad, when you go back to the market and rate "
