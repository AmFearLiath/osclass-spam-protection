"            This plugin I've developed at the request of the community in "
"the OSClass forum. \n"
"            There I was given lots of ideas and some have participated in "
"beta tests.\n"
"            <br />\n"
"            <ul>\n"
"            <li><strong>Web-Media</strong>   -   Improve the plugin "
"security</li>\n"
"            <li><strong>Aficionado</strong>  -   Testing and error "
"reporting...</li>\n"
"            <li><strong>dev101</strong>      -   Suggestions and explaining "
"features and functions</li>\n"
"            <li><strong>TangoX</strong>      -   Correcting some "

"            <strong>Thanks to all for your help!</strong>\n"
"            <br /><br />\n"
"            I hope this plugin will be useful to many of you and it helps "
"you to reduce the spam on your pages to a minimum. \n"
"            Keep in mind, however, that it was never intended to fight spam "
"automatically. \n"
"            It is just a tool to find and mark the spam for manually "
"editoring.\n"
"            <br /><br />\n"
"            An automated system would always involve the risk that even "
"realistic ads will be marked as spam and not published.\n"
"            <br /><br />\n"
"            If you find any errors, please report it in the forum and tell "
"it to me. \n"
"            I will try to fix this immediately, so that everyone can use "
"this plugin properly.<br /><br />\n"
"            Also i would be glad, when you go back to the market and rate "
"this plugin with some stars. I need weeks to develop this plugin for free, "
"you only need some minutes to rate and review it.<br /><br />\n"
