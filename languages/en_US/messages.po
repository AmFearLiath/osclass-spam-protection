"This plugin I've developed at the request of the community in the OSClass "
"forum. There I was given lots of ideas and some have participated in beta "
"tests.<br /><br /><strong>Thanks to all for your help!</strong><br /><br />I "
"hope this plugin will be useful to many of you and it helps you to reduce "
"the spam on your pages to a minimum. Keep in mind, however, that it was "
"never intended to fight spam automatically. It is just a tool to mark the "
"spam and to check it manually.<br /><br />An automated system would always "
"involve the risk that even realistic ads will be marked as spam and not "
"published.<br /><br />If you find any errors, please report it in the forum "
"and tell it to me. I will try to fix this immediately, so that everyone can "
"use this plugin properly."
